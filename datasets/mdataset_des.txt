#  Discussion:
#
#    The length of a species of fish is to be represented as a function
#    of the age and water temperature.  The fish are kept in tanks
#    at 25, 27, 29 and 31 degrees Celsius.  After birth, a test specimen
#    is chosen at random every 14 days and its length measured.
#
#    There are 44 rows of data.  The data include:
#
#      I,  the index;
#      A1, the age of the fish;
#      A2, the water temperature in degrees Celsius;
#      B,  the length of the fish.
#
#    We seek a model of the form:
#
#      B = A1 * X1 + A2 * X2
